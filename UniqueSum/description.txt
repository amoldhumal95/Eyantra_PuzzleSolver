Given:
A set of test inputs, each containing
• Two arrays, one for D1 and other for D2. One example test input is as follows:
Example 1:
D1 = [1, 2, 1, 3, 7, 6, 2, 9, 8, 1, 5, 4]
D2 = [ [5,10], [6,11], [15,15] ]
• Division D1 is a grid having 12 Cells numbered from 0 to 11 and D2 is a grid
having 24 Cells numbered from 0 to 23.
• The array for D1 gives the numbers in the cells starting from 0 to 11, whereas
array for D2 gives only the cell number and the number contained in that
corresponding cell.
• Each Cell in D1 contains a one digit number (i.e. number from 0 to 9) while any
one or two digits numbers only up to 20 (i.e. numbers from 0 to 20) are present in
some of the Cells in D2.


PROBLEM STATEMENT
• Teams Modify the puzzle () function in the file to process both the arrays and sum
up the numbers in D1 which results in a number present in D2.
• Similarly teams complete all the numbers in D2.
Note: a number in D1 which is used in getting sum of a number present in D2, cannot
be used again.
• Print the numbers used in D1for making the sum in D2.
